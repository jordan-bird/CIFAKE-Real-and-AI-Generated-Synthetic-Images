# CIFAKE: Real and AI-Generated Synthetic Images
The quality of AI-generated images has rapidly increased, leading to concerns of authenticity and trustworthiness.

CIFAKE is a dataset that contains 60,000 synthetically-generated images and 60,000 real images (collected from CIFAR-10). Can computer vision techniques be used to detect when an image is real or has been generated by AI?

Further information on this dataset can be found here: [Bird, J.J., Lotfi, A. (2023). CIFAKE: Image Classification and Explainable Identification of AI-Generated Synthetic Images. arXiv preprint arXiv:2303.14126.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14126)

## Dataset details
The dataset contains two classes - REAL and FAKE. 

For REAL, we collected the images from Krizhevsky & Hinton's [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

For the FAKE images, we generated the equivalent of CIFAR-10 with Stable Diffusion version 1.4

There are 100,000 images for training (50k per class) and 20,000 for testing (10k per class)

## Notes

The updates to the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birdy654/cifake-real-and-ai-generated-synthetic-images) dataset on the 28th of March 2023 did not change anything; the file formats ".jpeg" were renamed ".jpg" and the root folder was uploaded to meet Kaggle's usability requirements.
